## About My Experience

I have been coding for a little over a month now and have learned how to style an HTML page with Bootstrap CSS as well as some CSS of my own. This project I utilized Bootstrap to render my page like the example given in our directions. I have been learning Javascript in this time as well. This project was my first project using javascript to create a function that made the page dynamic.
